Name:  main.cpp
   Main program.  This is the driver program that calls sub-functions
   to read data from an input file, use the data to create two matrices,
   and compute and display their sum and product.

Name:  xxx.h (if you have one)
   Contains the definition for the class xxx.  

Name: xxx.cpp
   Defines and implements the xxx class for implementing a xxx.
   This class provides routines to construct and get the xxx, ...

*  How to build and run the program
*******************************************************

1. Uncompress the homework.  The homework file is compressed.  
   To uncompress it use the following commands 
       % unzip [1234HW1]

   Now you should see a directory named homework with the files:
        main.cpp
        xxx.h
        xxx.cpp
	yyy.h
	yyy.cpp
        makefile
        Readme.txt
	[any other supporting documents]

2. Build the program.

    Change to the directory that contains the file by:
    % cd [1234HW1] 

    Compile the program by:
    % make

3. Run the program by:
   % ./[xxx]

4. Delete the obj files, executables, and core dump by
   %./make clean
